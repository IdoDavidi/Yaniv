Welcome aboard to a game of Yaniv! these instructions apply to male and female as one :)
Each player begins of 5 cards, and the goal is to have total hand value of 7 or less.
every turn a player discards cards in the following manner:
either a single card, a multiple cards with the same rank, or a 3 or more consecutive cards in the same suit and ascending order (e.g 5-6-7 where 5 is discarded first, 6 second and 7 third)
Afterward a player draws a card from the deck or from the discarded pile.
if players draws card from the deck in the same rank as the last card he discarded, they may "SLAPDOWN": discarding the card they just drew in condition that the next player did not start his turn yet.
Once a player reached a total hand value of 7 or less they may declare YANIV on their turn.
if successful - all the current total hand values of each player will be added to their score table besides the caller.
However, if a counter ASAF is called by a different player in response, it means that player has equal or lower hand, in which case the YANIV caller gets 30 points addition to his score.
A player with a score of over 50 is out, last player wins the game.
if a player has a score of exactly 50, their score cuts down by half to 25.

important notes:
- JOKER and ACE values are 0 and 1 respectively. JOKER cannot be a part of consecutive discarding.
- royalty a.k.a Jack, Queen, King values are: 11, 12, 13 accordingly.
